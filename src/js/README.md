# CSS Kata JavaScript

The CSS kata project contains two modules that support dynamic rendering of UI components.
For example, the main tab menu uses JavaScript to manage which content to display when a tab is selected.

Most (or all) of this JavaScript can probably be replaced with pure CSS.
For example, **Chris Coyier** describes how to handle the tab menus using only CSS, in his article on
 [Functional CSS Tabs](http://css-tricks.com/functional-css-tabs-revisited/).
Using that technique, instead of JavaScript, is on the TODO list.

The modules:

* **[cssKataBaseModule](module-cssKataBaseModule.html)**: Contains support functions specific to CSS Kata and wouldn't be useful to any other project.
* **[genericSupportModule](module-genericSupportModule.html)**: Contains generic support functions that can be used in other projects as well as CSS Kata.
